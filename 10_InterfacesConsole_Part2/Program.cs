        //Inheritance:

        //1. Inheritance is not code-sharing
        //code-sharing is where we use a class or its members in another class for Example: using Episode in the show class or referencing a method from one class in another class.

        //2. Is-a Relationship Is a lion a cat....is a cat an Animal.

        //3. Need to share some common logic
        //sharing just properties or method signatures is not enough
        //if they all have completely different implementation this would be pointless might as well just write a brand new method

        //4. Inheritance can put you in a corner
        //when you overstretch the Is-a relationship. So this results in very tightly coupled code.

        //5. You ask what is the point
        //what is the value that you are creating.
